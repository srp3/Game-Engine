# Game-Engine
The interactive-fiction game engine we designed in class.
Directions to play game: There are 8 rooms, labled rooms 1,2,3,4,5...
Your goal is to escape the house, however only 1 room leads out of the house, can you figure out which one!? 

I am having a little bit of trouble with my code. I have done a good amount of it i feel like but i would like to make an appoitment with you for office hours or i will stop by, i will also email you about this, the readme is just a side note.
